We offer one round of editing per digital garment.\n\nEmail groundcontrol@special-items.com and let us know what changes\/adjustments you would like made. Once you’ve sent your notes, we will launch them to our digital tailors to make any changes that the Metaverse can handle. From there, you should have your updated image in your inbox in 1-2 days.\n\nRemember, we are digital tailors, not retouchers. Your image must be ready and edited as you see fit upon submission. We do not and will not alter your physical appearance.\n\nIn the case where you placed an order and paid, but haven’t provided the photo in 21 days, you will receive an automatic refund and you will not receive your order.\n\nWe hope you find these solutions pleasing.\n\nWe aim for Maximum Satisfaction at Special Items."
